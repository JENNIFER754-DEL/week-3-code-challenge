Flatiron Movie Theater
A simple web application that allows users to view movies, their details, and purchase tickets for a selected movie. This project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON data to simulate a movie theater experience.

Features
Display a list of movies available at the theater.
View movie details, including the title, poster, description, runtime, showtime, and available tickets.
Purchase tickets (updating ticket availability in real-time).
Movie data is fetched from a local JSON file and displayed dynamically.

Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the movie theater page.
CSS: Styling the page to ensure a responsive and clean layout.
JavaScript: Functionality for fetching and displaying data, and handling ticket purchase logic.
JSON: Movie data stored in a local db.json file.
Project Setup
Clone this repository: Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.

Install a local server: Since the application fetches data from a local server (via http://localhost:3000/films), you'll need to run a simple server to serve the db.json file. You can use json-server to achieve this.


Install json-server globally using your terminal, if you do not have it already

In the project directory, run the command to start the server.

Open the project: Open the index.html file in your browser to view the movie theater page.

How It Works
Main Interface: The page displays a list of films available. When a film is selected, its details (title, poster, description, runtime, showtime, and available tickets) will be shown.
Ticket Purchase: If there are available tickets, you can click the "Buy Ticket" button to increment the number of tickets sold. The button will update to "Sold Out" if no tickets are available.
